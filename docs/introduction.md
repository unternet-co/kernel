# Unternet Kernel

The Unternet Kernel consists of a series of modules which work in tandem to form the basis of an agentic operating system. It's capable of understanding user intent, executing actions, accumulating memory, and orchestrating a full grahical user interface with stateful processes.

## Goals

Unlike other reasoning libraries (e.g. LangChain, Semantic Kernel), Unternet's Kernel is built from the ground up to satisfy all of the following:

- Model-agnostic (including compatability with small, local, or open-source models)
- Orchestration of ongoing, stateful processes (not just one-off tool use)
- Open, pluggable architecture (so anyone can build applications for it or extend it)
- Abstraction over arbitrary tool-use protocols (compatible with MCP, Web Applets, and anything else that emerges)
- Can form the basis of a full GUI (not just a chat thread)
