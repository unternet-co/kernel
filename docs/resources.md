# Resources

A resource represents a group of related tools, with a name, icon, and description. This can be used to represent anything that can be identified, and which you can take action on.

An MCP server would be a common example of a resource. It's one "thing", which is distributed by an author, and we can assume that the tools inside it are related in some way. By using the `Resource` abstraction, you can use MCP servers, as well as other things we might consider resources like a website (using Web Applets), PDF or other file object, etc.
