In the realm of code where changes drift,
Lies the magic of the git diff.
Lines of text, both old and new,
In colors red and green, they view.

A symphony of change, a coder's gift,
To see what’s altered, what’s adrift.
With every commit, a story told,
In the diff, the secrets unfold.

A line removed, a line replaced,
In the diff, the past is traced.
A journey through the code's own tale,
In every diff, the details prevail.

So cherish the diff, this humble guide,
In the world of code, it’s our trusted side.
For in its lines, both terse and brief,
Lies the essence of our belief.
